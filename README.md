# Background_removal_project 

In this group project we explored current possibilites to remove the background of images using deep learning models, also called image matting.

# Dataset

For this project we used the DUTS dataset (http://saliencydetection.net/duts/) to improve on pretrained models using transfer learning.

# Approach

There're three main approaches: 
- With a trimap and pretrained model  
- Without a trimap -> ModNet model
- Deep Image Matting

# Trimap

trimap_creation.ipynb is a jupiter notebook used to create trimaps given an image folder

# ModNet

Explenation of the repo can be found on https://github.com/ZHKKKe/MODNet

# Deep Image Matting

Based on following github repo : https://github.com/adumrewal/imageMatting
Image Matting. Given an image, the code in this project can separate its foreground and background components.
This repository is to reproduce [Deep image matting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03872) and is a modification to the codes used by foamliu (https://github.com/foamliu/Deep-Image-Matting-PyTorch).
